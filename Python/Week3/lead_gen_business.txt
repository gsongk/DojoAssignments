Queries
1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
SELECT *
SELECT MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) AS month, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM billing
JOIN sites ON billing.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE charged_datetime LIKE '2012-03%';

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the
 client with an id of 2?
SELECT billing.client_id, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM billing
JOIN sites ON billing.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE sites.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?
SELECT domain_name AS website, client_id
FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month 
per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?
SELECT sites.client_id, COUNT(sites.site_id) as num_sites, DATE_FORMAT(sites.created_datetime, '%M') AS month_created, DATE_FORMAT(sites.created_datetime, '%Y') AS year_created
FROM sites
WHERE sites.client_id = 1
GROUP BY month_created, year_created;

SELECT sites.client_id, COUNT(sites.site_id) as num_sites, DATE_FORMAT(sites.created_datetime, '%M') AS month_created, DATE_FORMAT(sites.created_datetime, '%Y') AS year_created
FROM sites
WHERE sites.client_id = 20
GROUP BY month_created, year_created;

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for 
each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
SELECT sites.domain_name AS website, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads, DATE_FORMAT(registered_datetime, '%M %d %Y') AS date_generated
FROM leads
JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'
GROUP BY sites.site_id;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total 
# of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 
2011 to December 31, 2011?
SELECT CONCAT (clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads_id) AS number_of_leads
FROM leads
JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total 
# of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 
1 - 6 of Year 2011?
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS clients_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS number_of_leads, MONTHNAME(sites.registered_datetime) AS month_genereated
FROM leads
JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-06-31'
GROUP BY leads.leads_id;

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # 
of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 
2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a 
second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total 
number of leads generated from each site for all time.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, sites.domain_name AS website, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS number_of_leads, DATE_FORMAT(sites.created_datetime, '%M %d %Y') AS date_generated 
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE sites.created_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31' 
GROUP BY sites.domain_name;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each 
client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name,' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue, MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) AS month_charge, YEAR(charged_datetime) AS year_charge
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY CONCAT(clients.first_name, clients.last_name)
ORDER BY MONTH(charged_datetime) AND YEAR(charged_datetime)

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client 
owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will 
become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the 
sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS clients_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) AS websites
FROM sites
JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients_name
