        Clients and Servers
        <br>
        <ul>
        Computers connected to the <span>Web</span> are called <strong>clients</strong> and <strong>servers.</strong>
            <li><span>Clients</span> are the typical Web user's Inter-connected devices (for example, your computer connected
                to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your movile network) and <span>Web-accessing software</span> available
                on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrone).</li>
            <li><span>Servers</span> are computers that store <span>webpages, sites</span> or <span> apps</span>. When a client device wants to access access
                webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the uer's web browser.</li>
        </ul>

        So What Actually Happens?
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <ol>The browser goes to the <span>DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span>server</span> that the website lives on.</ol>
            <ol>The browser sends an <span>HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.</ol>
            <ol>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span>"200 OK" message</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", 
                and then starts sending the website's files to teh browser as a series of small chunks.</ol>
            <ol>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</ol>

        The Big 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        <br>
        While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that they serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
